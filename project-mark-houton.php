                    <h4>The Brief:</h4>
                    <p>Create a short film to profile the work of artist Mark Houghton.</p>
                    <h4>What we did:</h4>
                    <p>In July 2012 we ventured down to Hereford to interview Mark Houghton about his site-responsive practice and how he uses found objects to reinterpret the everyday. The result is a film with strong visual appeal that also provides a compelling insight into the artist's practice.</p>

                        <h5>Quote:</h5>
                        <p>I am extremely pleased with the resulting film, which has been added to vimeo, youtube and artplayer, as well as Axisweb.org and my own websites. </p> 
                        <p>It adds a valuable and interesting additional layer to my websites, and quickly allows someone insight into my work. The end result is both professional, but not too formal.</p>
                        <p>I would strongly recommend the service to other artists / Axis members as a way of promoting themselves , their work and their ideas.</p>
