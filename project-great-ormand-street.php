                    <h4>What we did:</h4>
                    <p>We were asked to introduce contemporary art into the hospitalâ€™s circulation spaces, using the themes (Butterfly, Bumblebee, Kingfisher and Ocean) currently employed for signage and navigation.</p>

                    <p>Working with Great Ormond Street Hospital, we chose a selection of works from the Axisweb.org directory which we felt would add something new to the hospital environment while also respecting the sensitivities of a diverse public.</p>  

                    <p>We created four films for installation on screens around the wards, exploring images by 23 artists working in a wide range of media, from drawing and painting to film and performance. </p>
