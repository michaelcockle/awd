			<h2>A brief history...</h2>

			<p>Axisweb (our parent) was founded in 1991 and is the leading promotional  platform for contemporary artists in the UK. </p>

			<p>For 21 years, we’ve been helping artists and other arts organisations embrace the potential of digital technology. In the 1990s we pioneered image reproduction tools, contributed to image data standards and made CD-ROMs. In 2000 we created a virtual gallery space that was ahead of its time. Since then we’ve moved on to building microsites, campaign sites, event listing websites and most recently iPhone apps.</p>

			<p>To promote these services more widely, we formed a trading subsidiary in 2005. All profits are gift-aided back to our parent company.</p>

			<h2>What we are about...</h2>

			<p>We help individuals and organisations in the arts exploit the full potential of digital technology to reach new audiences and further their organisational aims. </p>

			<p>Our team encompasses a unique combination of experience and expertise, including digital strategy, coding, front-end design, communications, audience development and artistic practice. We bridge the divide between art and digital technology.</p>
