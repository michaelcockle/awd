find the sweet spot of the type - sometimes on a computer it might look really good at 16px but not at 15 


typeface has a meaning an emotion
from the keywords of the meeting - adjectives -  use these to find the typeface most appropriate

look hard a the typeface, theme / style can be extended outwards, does it have rounded corners - then use rounded corners on the boxes ? 
line thickness, tone 

start with the body copy - this sets the tone
heading, captions, titles etc - these set the personality 



modular scale 

2 strands 

1 e.g. optimum font size for body copy e.g. 16 px

44 px for mobile buttons

Bootstrap is really a collection of tools to handle different aspects of rapid prototyping. I think you can do better by building your own collection out of the best tool in each area. In my mind, that's exactly what Compass is for. I can stop using massive frameworks, and start using modular plugins. Here's my go-to plugins for rapid prototyping. 

- Susy (grids)
- Compass (reset, css3, vertical rhythms)
- Modular-Scale (sizes)
- Solarized (colors)
- Sassy-Buttons (buttons)
- Breakpoint (media-queries)
- Animate (animations)

The great part is I can modify the stack depending on the project. I rarely use all 7, and I occasionally add in something like Compass-CSS-Arrow when I need it. It's hard to build a css toolkit, which is why things like bootstrap exist. But it's easy to build a Compass toolkit. Best of all, these plugins don't cut corners. Bootstrap cares more about your alpha than it does about your long-term goals. I'd rather use tools that get me a quick alpha AND keep working for me through the entire life of the project.

Axisweb Developments
A digital agency for the arts

HOME PAGE

Axisweb Developments is a digital agency for the arts.  Our team of art, technology and strategic specialists work with people and organisations in the arts, helping them achieve success using digital solutions.

SERVICES 

We work across a broad range of digital disciplines to produce solutions that engage your audience and ultimately connects them with you.

Every project, big or small goes through our responsive design process: discovery, design, development, delivery and review.  At the core of our approach is collaboration and ensuring what we deliver is right for you.

Strategy
“if you build it they will come” - doesn’t really work, but many still do it!

We offer help and advice and try to bring clear thinking in a fast changing digital world.  Digital strategy is about understanding how all digital elements such as website, social media, search engine optimisation, digital marketing - work together for a single purpose. 

Our role is to find solutions and uncover opportunities that will help achieve your goals. 

Web
Whether you’re after a small microsite or a socially integrated digital platform, we can take on the whole process from concept creation , information architecture (IA), user experience (UX), design and build.

We work closely with you to understand your needs and select the most appropriate (and cost effective) solution and system from open source to off-the-shelf to bespoke.

Mobile
Welcome to the mobile revolution, well to be exact we have been here a few years now!

We can help you develop a “mobile” approach and understand better the context and consumption patterns of your audience.  We believe mobile should deliver a great experience for mobile users.  We can create you a mobile solution be it a website or an App, and would ensure the solution adds value to your proposition.

Films
Film is a powerful medium which can engage, inform, provoke and inspire.

We provide filmmaking and digital video marketing solutions.  With our own filmmaking team we can offer a range of solutions covering concept, production, post production and viral video services.  

We would work closely with you, offering bespoke solutions for each project.  Whether it's a short two minute film or a series of more in-depth case studies. We use the latest filmmaking technology including state of the art HDLSR cameras that shoot Full HD footage, providing rich, 'filmic' visuals that ensures your project stands out.

Training
One of our goals is to help people in the arts use digital to transform and expand their offer.    We believe if people in the arts understand the nuts and bolts of digital, they will have better conversations and make better decisions as a result.

We cover a range of topics including:
Understanding your audience
Planning your website
Optimising your website
Tracking your success
Writing for the web
Creating rich media
Social media

Our workshops have been designed for individuals and organisations in the arts, in fact anybody who is interested in developing digital solutions to better support their business aims and artistic programme.

ABOUT US
We are unique, in that we are a digital agency for the arts.  

A brief history...
Axisweb (our parent) was founded in 1991 and is the leading digital platform for practising artists in the UK.  For 21 years, we have been involved in developing digital solutions for artists and other organisations in the arts.   We have always used digital, in the 1990s we pioneered image reproduction tools, informing image data standards, CD-ROMs, in 2000 we created a virtual gallery space and then moved on to building microsites, campaign sites, event listing websites and most recently iPhone Apps.

Due to the requests from other organisations, Axisweb formed a trading subsidiary to deliver digital solutions to the arts.  Any profits made are gift-aided back to our parent.


What we are about...
Our aim is to provide digital leadership to the art sector.  We do this be continuing to support other organisations in creating and delivering new digital solutions aimed at widening participation in the arts.  

We are uniquely placed, as our team encompasses coders, designers, strategists, artists, and art professionals.  We bridge the divide between art and digital technology.
