                    <h4>The Brief:</h4>
                    <p>Develop a digital destination to showcase contemporary art in the North East of England.</p>

                    <h4>What we did:</h4>
                        <p>Many of the organisations involved in the CANE consortium were small and had limited digital provision for promoting their activities. Building on the success of our Art in Yorkshire web platform and iPhone App, we re-used the model to create a simple, scalable website and iPhone App, with the potential to integrate social media networks and encourage audience engagement.</p>
