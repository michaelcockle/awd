                    <h4>The Brief:</h4>
                        <p>Create a cultural events and listings website (DigYorkshire) for Audiences Yorkshire, to include a new visual identity and a more personalised user experience. </p>

                    
                    <h4>What we did:</h4>
                        <p>We worked closely with the DigYorkshire team in order to understand and define their new offer. The outcome was a website that offered greater user control, online ticketing facilities and full social media integration, making it easy for venues to promote their events and expand their audience. </p>

                        <p>The Axis team has been brilliant to work with. We’re delighted with what we’ve been able to achieve. The new site is a huge leap forward and feedback from our users has been fantastic.</p>
