                    <h4>The Brief:</h4>
                    <p>Audiences Central wanted to completely re-develop their existing events listing and mailing list service. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="span6">
                    <h4>What we did:</h4>
                    <p>The challenge for this project was to re-skin an existing site (digyorkshire.com) and import existing mailing list data for more than 25,000 subscribers within a very short period of time. We rose to the challenge and after only two weeks of system “cloning”, data-transfer and re-skinning, Scene Central was launched in July 2009. </p>
