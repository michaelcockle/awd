                    <h4>The Brief:</h4>
                    <p>Devise and implement a digital strategy for this year-long programme of exhibitions across Yorkshire led by York Museums Trust and supported by Tate. </p>

                    <h4>What we did:</h4>
                        <p>We worked closely with Art in Yorkshire to devise a digital strategy to support the programme.  This involved running an ideation workhop with gallery and museum staff from around the region.</p>


                        <p>The key to the project was developing good content.  This informed the creation of a rich user experience and the idea to create an iPhone App.  </p>

                        <p>Our role was overseeing technical developments and delivering the digital programme.  We  commissioned and produced content such as films, podcasts and writing and developed a social media campaign to encourage engagement and interaction.</p>

                        <p>During July 2011, the App featured in Apple’s iTunes “What’s Hot” list, followed by several weeks in the “New and Noteworthy” section.</p> 

                        <p>The Art in Yorkshire app has been nominated for a number of awards over the past 18 months, most recently winning a Roses Gold award in May 2012 for ‘Best App’.</p>
