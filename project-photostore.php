                    <p>Widen access to the Crafts Council's resource of makers.</p>

                    <h4>What we did:</h4>
                        <p>We ran ideation sessions with Crafts Council staff to define key drivers that would inform the interactive elements of the website.</p>

                        <p>We worked closely with the graphic design agency responsible for the Crafts Council's brand to ensure that Photostore not only had the right look and feel but also offered a great user experience.</p>

                        <p>Photostore was launched in 2004 and became an invaluable tool for commissioning and researching contemporary craft.</p>

                        <p>From launch there was a high demand from the public, allowing a large degree of  self-service, increased access and in turn greater exposure for the content. User  feedback was very positive.</p>
