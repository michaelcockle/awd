                    <h4>The Brief:</h4>
                        <p>Run a practical and inspirational seminar for the Contemporary Visual Arts Network in the North East about how to create better content for the web.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What we did:</h4>
                        <p>We designed a series of presentations and activities aimed at helping curators and marketing professionals think carefully about the needs of their online audience. </p>

                        <p>Topics covered included user journeys, analytics, search engine optimisation, writing for the web and emerging trends in web technology. Emma Hutson, a former digital producer with the BBC, contributed particular expertise around commissioning and creating film.</p>
